We've just released **GridSwitch v1.1** with a handy new navigation feature.

## What's New: Ctrl Key Reverse Navigation

While the grid is open and you're holding Cmd, you can now press **Ctrl** to move the selection **backward** — no need to reach for Shift+Tab.

This means you can navigate entirely with your left hand:

- **Cmd+Tab** — Open the switcher and move forward
- **Tab** — Move to the next app
- **Ctrl** — Move to the previous app
- Release **Cmd** — Switch to the selected app

All keys are within easy reach of your left hand, making the whole flow faster and more ergonomic.

## Why Ctrl?

Shift+Tab already works for backward navigation, but it requires pressing two keys simultaneously while holding Cmd — a three-key combo that can be awkward. Ctrl is a single key press right next to Cmd, making it a natural choice for quick backward steps.

## Other Navigation Options

As a reminder, GridSwitch supports multiple ways to navigate the grid:

- **Arrow keys** — Move in any direction
- **Tab / Shift+Tab** — Move forward / backward
- **Cmd+Tab / Cmd+Shift+Tab** — Move forward / backward
- **Ctrl** — Move backward (new in v1.1)
- **Number keys (1–9)** — Jump directly to an app
- **Mouse click** — Click any app icon
- **Q** — Quit the selected app
