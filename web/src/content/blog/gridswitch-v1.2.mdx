**GridSwitch v1.2** is here with a feature that makes staying current effortless.

## What's New: Automatic Update Checking

GridSwitch now checks for new versions automatically. No more manually visiting GitHub Releases to see if there's an update.

### How It Works

- **On launch**: GridSwitch silently checks GitHub for the latest release. If a new version is found, you'll see a notification.
- **From the menu**: Click **"Check for Updates..."** in the menu bar to manually check anytime.

When an update is available, you'll see a dialog showing the new version number. Click **"Update Now"** and GridSwitch will:

1. Download the latest release
2. Replace the current app
3. Relaunch automatically

The entire process takes just a few seconds.

### Safe and Transparent

- Before replacing the app, a backup is created. If anything goes wrong, the previous version is restored automatically.
- All downloads come directly from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/hisashihirajo/GridSwitch/releases) — no third-party servers involved.
- If you're not ready to update, click **"Later"** and you won't be bothered until the next launch.

## Download

[Download GridSwitch v1.2](https://github.com/hisashihirajo/GridSwitch/releases/tag/v1.2) from GitHub.

Already running GridSwitch? Use **"Check for Updates..."** from the menu bar to update directly.
