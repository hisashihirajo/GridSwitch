We're thrilled to announce the first release of **GridSwitch** — a grid-based application switcher for macOS that reimagines how you navigate between apps.

## Why We Built GridSwitch

The default macOS app switcher (Cmd+Tab) displays a single horizontal row of icons. It works, but when you have 20+ apps running, scrolling through a long strip gets tedious. We wanted something better: a **visual grid** that lets you see all your running apps at once.

## What's Included in v1.0

### Grid Layout
Instead of a horizontal strip, GridSwitch displays your running applications in a customizable grid. You can configure the number of columns (4–12) and icon size (32–128px) to fit your workflow.

### Seamless Activation
GridSwitch intercepts the native Cmd+Tab shortcut. No new keyboard shortcuts to memorize — just press the same keys you've always used.

### Number Key Shortcuts
Press 1–9 to instantly jump to an app by its position in the grid. This is especially useful when you know exactly which app you need.

### Full Customization
- **Background**: Set a custom color, opacity, or even a background image
- **Icon size**: Adjust from 32px to 128px
- **Grid columns**: Configure 4–12 columns per row
- **Hidden apps**: Exclude specific apps from the switcher

### Bilingual Support
GridSwitch supports both English and Japanese interfaces out of the box.

## Getting Started

1. Download GridSwitch from our website
2. Move it to your Applications folder
3. Launch the app — it runs in the menu bar
4. Grant Accessibility permission when prompted
5. Press Cmd+Tab and enjoy the new grid view!

## What's Next

We're actively working on improvements. Here are some features we're considering:

- Mouse/trackpad support for clicking apps directly
- Theming presets
- More keyboard shortcut options
- Performance optimizations

## Open Source

GridSwitch is free and open source. We believe a better app switcher should be accessible to everyone. Contributions, feedback, and feature requests are all welcome!
